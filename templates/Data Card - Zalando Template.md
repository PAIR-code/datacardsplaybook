<!-- info: List the dataset fields and their descriptions.
**Do not create a second source of truth.**  If information about tables already

If there are many tables to describe,
a data card might not be the best place to describe them all.  If there is
no other table schematization tool being used, consider adding only the
most relevant info here if it's likely not to change.

For `Type` use [python typing standards](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).

Note, figures are worth 1000 tables. When possible, default
to using figures such as histograms over statistical tables.
