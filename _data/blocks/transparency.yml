- Transparency, at its heart, is a clear, easily understandable, and plain
  language explanation of what something is, what it does, and why it does

  dataset's quality, validity, reproducibility, and riskâ€”all in a way that's
  accessible to the various audiences who may interact with it, including
  developers, business stakeholders, downstream users, and more.
