# Interactive Calculator

![](https://github.com/taylorylee/interactivecalculator/blob/main/docs/workingprototypeinteractivecalc.gif)

An interactive, collaborative activity tracker for navigating tradeoffs in data and modelling AI cards. In preproduction.

## What it does

The interactive calculator allows you and your team to facilitate more open collaboration when capturing and navigating tradeoffs to determine whatâ€™s best for your Data Card creation process

Some current features include:

- Hover explanations about data card concepts. That way, everyone involved understands technical definitions and what it means to reformulate a format in the process
- Select and add text inputs, drag and drop ratings with guiding discussion questions for agents and dimensions
- Based on your inputs, automatically see the tradeoffs in a data visualization
- Save and share your outcomes for reference and discussions as a screenshot

## Who is this tool mainly for

While it's created so that anyone from any level can get involved, it's mainly targeted towards:

- Intermediate users. This is because beginners, first-timers to the program or content in general. With intermediates, it means giving access to the core features and tools necessary to explore. 

- Workshop facilitators or faciliators in general. They establish an envionrment for participants to be effective and are responsible for running the Playbook through its course.

- Producers create the datasets and or documentation. This can include design, creation, quality testing, and documentation. Such roles include e.g., Researchers, Data Scientist, Product/Program Manager
